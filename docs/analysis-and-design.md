# üìä CV Builder System - Service-Oriented Analysis & Design

## 1. üéØ Problem Statement

Our system addresses the need for a professional CV builder platform designed for job seekers and professionals to create, manage, and version control their resumes with a document-editing experience similar to Google Docs. Users need to create professional CVs without design expertise, track version history, maintain consistent formatting, and reduce time spent on CV organization.

**Target Users**: 
- Job seekers and students entering the job market
- Career professionals updating their credentials
- HR departments helping candidates prepare resumes

**Business Value**:
- Easy creation of professional CVs without design expertise
- Complete version history tracking for all changes
- Consistent CV formatting across multiple templates
- Significant time savings on CV formatting and organization

## 2. üß© REST Service Modeling Process

Following a comprehensive service-oriented approach, we utilized a structured 15-step REST service modeling process to design our microservices. The process begins with business process decomposition and gradually refines into concrete service definitions.

### Step 1: Decompose Business Process

**User Authentication Process**:
- Register new user
- Login user
- Validate authentication token
- Reset password
- Update user credentials

**Profile Management Process**:
- Create user profile
- Update user profile information
- Retrieve user profile
- Delete user profile

**CV Creation and Management Process**:
- Initialize new CV
- Select CV template
- Add CV section
- Edit CV section content
- Delete CV section
- Rename CV
- List user's CVs
- Retrieve specific CV
- Delete CV

**Version Management Process**:
- Record content change event
- Sign event with cryptographic signature
- Store event in chronological order
- Retrieve CV state at specific version
- Rollback to previous version
- Compare versions

### Step 2: Filter Out Unsuitable Actions

We identified actions unsuitable for service implementation:
- Manual template design process (handled by designers outside the system)
- Manual CV content verification (responsibility of the user)
- Physical sharing of printed CVs (outside system boundaries)

### Step 3: Define Entity Service Candidates

Entity service candidates that manage specific business entities:

**User Entity Service**:
- Get User Profile
- Update User Profile
- Create User Profile
- Manages user data as a fundamental business entity

**CV Entity Service**:
- Get CV
- List CVs
- Get CV Sections
- Create CV Record
- Manages CV data as a core business entity

**Event Entity Service**:
- Get Event
- Get Event History
- Verify Event Integrity
- Manages event data for audit and history

**Template Entity Service**:
- Get Template
- List Templates
- Apply Template
- Manages template data as a business entity

### Step 4: Identify Process-Specific Logic

Task services that orchestrate business processes:

**Authentication Task Service**:
- Register
- Login
- Validate Token
- Orchestrates the authentication process

**CV Editing Task Service**:
- Create CV
- Update CV Section
- Delete CV Section
- Rename CV
- Orchestrates CV editing workflows

**Version Management Task Service**:
- Record Version
- Retrieve Version
- Compare Versions
- Orchestrates version control processes

### Step 5: Identify Resources

**User Resources**:
- /users/ - User accounts
- /profiles/ - User profile information

**CV Resources**:
- /cvs/ - CV documents
- /sections/ - CV content sections
- /templates/ - CV formatting templates

**Event Resources**:
- /events/ - Change events
- /versions/ - CV versions

### Step 6: Associate Service Capabilities with Resources and Methods

We associated service capabilities with appropriate HTTP methods and resources:

**User Service**:
- Get User Profile (GET + /profiles/{userId})
- Update User Profile (PUT + /profiles/{userId})
- Create User Profile (POST + /profiles/)

**CV-Command Service**:
- Create CV (POST + /cvs/)
- Add Section (POST + /cvs/{cvId}/sections/)
- Update Section (PUT + /cvs/{cvId}/sections/{sectionId})
- Delete Section (DELETE + /cvs/{cvId}/sections/{sectionId})
- Rename CV (PUT + /cvs/{cvId}/title)
- Change Template (PUT + /cvs/{cvId}/template)

**CV-Query Service**:
- Get CV (GET + /cvs/{cvId})
- List CVs (GET + /cvs/)
- Get CV Version (GET + /cvs/{cvId}/versions/{versionId})
- List CV Versions (GET + /cvs/{cvId}/versions/)

**Auth Service**:
- Register (POST + /auth/register)
- Login (POST + /auth/login)
- Validate Token (POST + /auth/validate)

### Step 7: Apply Service-Orientation

We applied service-orientation principles to refine our service candidates:

**Service Autonomy**: Each service is designed to have high independence from other services. For example, the CV-Command service manages its own event store while the CV-Query service manages its own projections.

**Service Statelessness**: All service operations are designed to be stateless, with state information stored in databases rather than in service memory.

**Service Discoverability**: Services are named descriptively and include standard documentation to promote discoverability.

**Service Composability**: Services are designed to be composed together to form more complex functionalities. For example, the CV-Query service composes with Auth service for user verification.

**Service Loose Coupling**: Services interact through well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies.

### Step 8: Identify Service Composition Candidates

Primary service compositions:

**User Registration Flow**:
```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (register) ‚Üí User Service (create profile)
```

**CV Creation Flow**:
```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (validate) ‚Üí CV-Command Service (create CV) ‚Üí Event Store ‚Üí CV-Query Service (build projection)
```

**CV Editing Flow**:
```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (validate) ‚Üí CV-Command Service (edit section) ‚Üí Event Store ‚Üí CV-Query Service (update projection)
```

**CV Viewing Flow**:
```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (validate) ‚Üí CV-Query Service (get CV with template)
```

### Step 9: Analyze Processing Requirements

Each service's processing requirements:

**Auth Service**:
- Requires secure password hashing
- Needs JWT token generation and validation
- Must maintain user credential security

**User Service**:
- Needs profile data storage and retrieval
- Requires authorization checks before profile updates

**CV-Command Service**:
- Requires event signing for integrity
- Needs atomic event persistence
- Must validate user ownership of CVs

**CV-Query Service**:
- Requires efficient projection building
- Needs version history management
- Must apply templates to CV content

### Step 10: Define Utility Service Candidates

Utility services that provide application functions across multiple business contexts:

**API Gateway Utility Service**:
- Route (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE + /*)
- Forward Authentication Headers (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE + /*)
- Provides infrastructure support functions

**Notification Utility Service** (future enhancement):
- Send Email (POST + /notifications/email)
- Send In-App Alert (POST + /notifications/alerts)
- Provides cross-cutting notification capabilities

### Step 11: Define Microservice Candidates

These microservice are candidates that have specific autonomy and scaling needs:

**Auth Microservice**:
- Register (POST + /auth/register)
- Login (POST + /auth/login)
- Validate (POST + /auth/validate)
- Highly specialized for security processing

**User Microservice**:
- GetProfile (GET + /profiles/{userId})
- UpdateProfile (PUT + /profiles/{userId})
- CreateProfile (POST + /profiles/)
- Independently deployable user management

**CV-Command Microservice**:
- CreateCV (POST + /cvs/)
- UpdateSection (PUT + /cvs/{cvId}/sections/{sectionId})
- DeleteSection (DELETE + /cvs/{cvId}/sections/{sectionId})
- RenameCV (PUT + /cvs/{cvId}/title)
- Specialized for write operations with event sourcing

**CV-Query Microservice**:
- GetCV (GET + /cvs/{cvId})
- ListCVs (GET + /cvs/)
- GetVersion (GET + /cvs/{cvId}/versions/{versionId})
- Specialized for read operations with projection processing

### Step 12: Apply Service-Orientation to Utility Services

Applied service-orientation principles to utility services:

**API Gateway**:
- Designed for high availability and scalability
- Implements service abstraction to hide backend complexity
- Centralized authentication and logging

### Step 13: Revise Service Composition Candidates

After reviewing all services, we finalized these service compositions:

**CV Editing Composition**:
```
Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Auth Service ‚Üí CV-Command Service ‚Üí Event Store ‚Üí CV-Query Service
```

**CV Viewing Composition**:
```
Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Auth Service ‚Üí CV-Query Service ‚Üí Template Application
```

### Step 14: Revise Resource Definitions

We refined our resource definitions to ensure clarity:

**Auth Resources**:
- /auth/register - User registration endpoint
- /auth/login - User login endpoint
- /auth/validate - Token validation endpoint

**User Resources**:
- /profiles/{userId} - User profile information

**CV Resources**:
- /cvs/ - Collection of CVs
- /cvs/{cvId} - Individual CV
- /cvs/{cvId}/sections - Collection of sections in a CV
- /cvs/{cvId}/sections/{sectionId} - Individual section in a CV
- /cvs/{cvId}/versions - Collection of CV versions
- /cvs/{cvId}/versions/{versionId} - Specific CV version

### Step 15: Revise Resource Definitions and Capability Grouping

We finalized our service structure with clearly defined resource boundaries:

**Auth Service**: Handles all authentication operations with JWT token generation
- Resources: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/validate
- Database: MongoDB auth store

**User Service**: Manages user profile information
- Resources: /profiles/*
- Database: MongoDB user profile store

**CV-Command Service**: Processes all CV write operations as events
- Resources: /cvs/* (write operations)
- Database: MongoDB event store

**CV-Query Service**: Handles all CV read operations via projections
- Resources: /cvs/* (read operations)
- Database: MongoDB projection store

**API Gateway**: Routes all requests to appropriate services
- Resources: /* (all endpoints)
- No database (stateless)
