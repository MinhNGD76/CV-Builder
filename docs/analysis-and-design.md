- Career professionals updating their credentials
- HR departments helping candidates prepare resumes

**Business Value**:
- Allows users to create professional CVs without design expertise
- Provides version history tracking for all changes
- Enables consistent CV formatting across templates
- Reduces time spent on CV formatting and organization

## 2. üîÑ Detailed Business Process Steps

1. **User Account Management**:
   - User registers with email and password
   - User logs in with credentials
   - System generates and issues JWT token
   - User manages personal profile information

2. **CV Creation and Management**:
   - User initiates creation of a new CV with title and template selection
   - System assigns unique identifier (cvId) to the CV
   - System records CV creation as an event with timestamp and signature
   - User can list and select from their created CVs

3. **CV Content Editing**:
   - User adds different section blocks (personal info, education, experience)
   - User updates existing content in sections
   - User removes unwanted sections
   - User renames CV title as needed
   - User changes CV template as desired
   - System captures each change as a discrete signed event

4. **Version Management**:
   - System logs each content change event with timestamp and user ID
   - Events are stored with cryptographic signatures for integrity
   - System allows reconstruction of CV state from event stream
   - User can undo recent changes as needed

5. **CV Access and Viewing**:
   - User can view their CV with applied template
   - System reconstructs CV state from stored events
   - User can access their CV via unique URL

## 3. üìã Business Process Components Identification

Based on the detailed business process steps, we identify the following key components:

## 6. üíº Service Interaction Analysis

The business processes require the following service interactions:

### User Authentication Flow
1. Frontend collects credentials
2. Gateway routes authentication request to Auth Service
3. Auth Service validates credentials and issues JWT
4. Frontend stores JWT for subsequent requests

### User Profile Management Flow
1. Frontend sends profile data with JWT
2. Gateway validates JWT and routes to User Service
3. User Service creates or updates profile
4. User Service returns updated profile data

### CV Creation Flow
1. Frontend sends CV creation request with JWT
2. Gateway routes request to CV-Command Service
3. CV-Command Service validates request
4. CV-Command Service emits CV_CREATED event
5. CV-Command Service returns success response

### CV Editing Flow
1. Frontend sends section modification with JWT
2. Gateway routes to CV-Command Service
3. CV-Command Service emits appropriate event (SECTION_ADDED, SECTION_UPDATED, etc.)
4. Event is stored in the event store with signature
5. CV-Query Service detects new event
6. CV-Query Service updates its projection

### CV Viewing Flow
1. Frontend requests CV data with JWT
2. Gateway routes to CV-Query Service
