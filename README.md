=======
CV Builder is an innovative platform that revolutionizes the way professionals create, manage, and version control their resumes. Using a microservices architecture with event sourcing principles, our application provides a Google Docs-like experience with additional capabilities specific to CV creation.

### Motivation
>>>>>>> 0c22ca28609e46bf3e39a809d4d90723d0e16895

Traditional CV builders lack flexibility, version control, and often produce generic-looking results. We wanted to create a solution that gives users complete control over their professional presentation while maintaining an intuitive interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

**Microservices** structure includes:

| Service       | Responsibility                          | Tech Stack         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `auth`        | User authentication and JWT issuance     | NestJS + MongoDB   |
| `user`        | User profile management                  | NestJS + MongoDB   |
| `cv-command`  | Append-only event storage (CV actions)   | NestJS + MongoDB   |
| `cv-query`    | Read model projection from events        | NestJS + MongoDB   |
| `gateway`     | API Gateway routing frontend calls       | NestJS + Axios     |
| `frontend`    | Block-based resume editor and UI         | React + Vite       |
=======
### Problem Solved

CV Builder addresses several key challenges in resume creation:
- **Version Control**: Track all changes with a complete chronological history
- **Template Flexibility**: Switch between visual templates without losing content
- **Content Organization**: Structured sections make information management intuitive
- **Collaborative Potential**: Architecture supports future collaborative editing features
- **Data Integrity**: Event sourcing ensures no data is ever lost
>>>>>>> 0c22ca28609e46bf3e39a809d4d90723d0e16895

### Learning Outcomes

<<<<<<< HEAD
## üîÅ Data Flow (CQRS + Event Sourcing)

1. User sends API request to `gateway`
2. `cv-command` emits events and stores them in MongoDB
3. `cv-command` pushes events to `cv-query` via internal REST call
4. `cv-query` updates the projection (read model)
5. `frontend` fetches final data from `cv-query` through read APIs

=======
Building this system provided valuable insights into:
- Implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern
- Designing event-driven microservices architecture
- Applying event sourcing for data persistence and history
- Securing distributed systems with JWT authentication
- Creating scalable and maintainable service boundaries

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project implements a microservices architecture with event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns:

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/asset/system-architecture.png" alt="System Architecture" width="700px"/>
</div>

### Key Components

- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Auth Service**: Handles user registration and authentication
- **User Service**: Manages user profile information
- **CV Command Service**: Processes write operations as events
- **CV Query Service**: Builds read-optimized projections from events

For detailed architecture information, see [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
